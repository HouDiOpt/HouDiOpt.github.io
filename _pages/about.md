I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at National University of Singapore, advised by [Prof. Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/). I received my B.S. degree from the Tang Aoqing Mathematics Honors Program at Jilin University in 2022. 
I work on

- Matrix optimization, especially semidefinite programming
- Fast algorithms for large-scale optimization problems in data science

Here is my [CV](/files/CV_HouDi.pdf)

<!--
My research focuses on developing efficient, robust, and scalable algorithms for large-scale optimization problems. I am currently working on solving convex relaxations of nonconvex models that arise in engineering, scientific computing, and machine learning. My interests include:
- Semidefinite programming
- Doubly nonnegative relaxation
- Matrix optimization
- Riemannian optimization
